        <h2>The Merry Wives of Windsor</h2>
        <h4>Act 1, Scene 3 A room in the Garter Inn.</h4>
        <p>
            Enter FALSTAFF, Host, BARDOLPH, NYM, PISTOL, and ROBIN<br>
            <br>
            FALSTAFF<br>
                Mine host of the Garter!<br>
            <br>
            Host<br>
                What says my bully-rook? speak scholarly and wisely.<br>
            <br>
            FALSTAFF<br>
                Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my<br>
                followers.<br>
            <br>
            Host<br>
                Discard, bully Hercules; cashier: let them wag; trot, trot.<br>
            <br>
            FALSTAFF<br>
                I sit at ten pounds a week.<br>
            <br>
            Host<br>
                Thou'rt an emperor, Caesar, Keisar, and Pheezar. I<br>
                will entertain Bardolph; he shall draw, he shall<br>
                tap: said I well, bully Hector?<br>
            <br>
            FALSTAFF<br>
                Do so, good mine host.<br>
            <br>
            Host<br>
                I have spoke; let him follow.<br>
            To BARDOLPH<br>
                Let me see thee froth and lime: I am at a word; follow.<br>
                Exit<br>
            <br>
            FALSTAFF<br>
                Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade:<br>
                an old cloak makes a new jerkin; a withered<br>
                serving-man a fresh tapster. Go; adieu.<br>
